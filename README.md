**This is a test driver, I use this repo to keep track of my kernel development.**

### Driver
At some point in the future, once getting into more â€œAdvanced" stuff this will not be maintained... </br>
For MSVC implementation, you can checkout this [branch](https://github.com/LongpanZhou/KernelDriver/tree/MSVC). </br>

### User
This is the usermode application in ring3, which handles communication and lazy imports... (This will not be updated once getting into "Advanced" stuff) </br>
